# JAX-AMR: A JAX-based adaptive mesh refinement framework

JAX-AMR is an adaptive mesh refinement framework based on dynamically updated multi-layer blocks with fixed positions and fixed shapes. This framework is fully compatible with JIT and vectorized operations.

## Implementation Strategy
The multi-layer blocks and the partitioning and refinement strategies in JAX-AMR are illustrated as follows.

For the detailed implementation strategies of JAX-AMR, please refer to our [paper](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2504.13750).

## Quick Installation
JAX-AMR modules can be easily installed using pip install git:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/JA4S/JAX-AMR.git
```

## Example
An example for the conjunction of a simple CFD solver with JAX-AMR are provided [here](https://github.com/JA4S/JAX-AMR/tree/main/examples).

Open [jax_amr_basic_example.ipynb](https://github.com/JA4S/JAX-AMR/blob/main/examples/jax_amr_basic_example.ipynb) in Google Colab to run the example.

The density result and refinement level for the example are shown as follows.
